# CITIBIKE-DATACLASSIFICATION
The repository is dedicated to archiving 
fundamental data and codes related to urban scientific research. 
In this study, we introduce a novel approach to categorize and analyze 
large-scale shared bike data by utilizing the Google API. We classify the 
relationship between shared bicycles and public transportation into three 
types: competition, integration, and complementation. Additionally, 
we overlay multi-urban environment data of the city to further investigate 
the influence of the built environment on this relationship between shared 
bicycles and public transportation.

## Requirements
+ QGIS software
+ Jupyter Lab

## Python Requirements
+ Datetime
+ Pandas
+ Numpy
+ Googlemaps

## Usage
+ CITI Bike data preprocessing
+ Run the STEP1 code to extract the competition data
+ Run the STEP2 code to extract the fusion relationship data and the complementary relationship data
+ QGIS data visualization
+ STATA was used to establish a regression model of the three relationships with multi-urban environment data
